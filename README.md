# Data Analysis on DataCo Supply Chain

Welcome to the Data Analysis on DataCo Supply Chain project where I leverage my SQL proficiency for data analysis and turning those insights into a dynamic, interactive dashboard powered by Power BI

<br>
This project involves analyzing the DataCo supply chain dataset to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. By leveraging advanced SQL queries and Power BI visualizations, we aim to address the following key aspects:
</br>

1. **Inventory Analysis**: Understand inventory levels and turnover rates across different product categories to optimize stock levels and reduce stockouts.

2. **Shipment Delay Analysis**: Investigate factors contributing to shipment delays and identify opportunities to streamline the shipping process.

3. **Late Delivery Trends**: Analyze the seasonality of late delivery rates to identify trends and patterns over time.
